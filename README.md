* Ellipsometry parameters psi and delta
* Arbitrary number of layers
* All-numpy implementation

* `fabryperot_single`: A Fabry-PÃ©rot cavity from a single thin silica layer. This example calculates the reflection spectra from the cavity for s and p polarisations and exposes some of the more fundamental functions used in psi_delta and fabryperot_multi.

* `brewsters`: [Brewster's angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster's_angle) is the angle at which light of a particular polarisation is perfectly transmitted through a transparent dielectric surface. This example plots reflection and transmission of s and p polarised light in air incident on a glass surface.
